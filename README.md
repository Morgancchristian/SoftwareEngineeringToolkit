# Software Engineering Toolkit

A collection of code and concepts I believe every software engineer should be able to implement from memory. This isn’t about building huge systems—it's about mastering the foundational building blocks that make us better developers.

## What This Repo Is For

- **Muscle Memory**: Reinforce programming fundamentals by re-implementing them from scratch—no copy-paste, no lookup.
- **Core Competency Portfolio**: Showcase clean, minimal implementations of essential data structures, algorithms, and utilities.
- **Interview Prep**: Use this as a personal prep kit for technical interviews—practical and reliable.
- **Teaching & Mentoring**: Share foundational knowledge with mentees or junior devs looking to grow.
- **Sharpness Maintenance**: A space to revisit, revise, and refine the things that matter most.
